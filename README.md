# About me


I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Broadly speaking, I do research in stochastic analysis and partial differential equations (PDE). I'm particularly interested in the effects that rough or stochastic noise has on systems coming from the physical or social sciences. 

Some specific topics I'm interested in are

- Interacting agent systems
- Mean field models in game and control theory
- Rough paths
- Nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations
- Homogenization
